Obj. 2. Non crederem Evangelio, nisi me commoveret Ecclesiae Catholicae Authoritas,Quibus lect is verbis adeo exultant, quasi reperissent id quod pu••i in faba se reperisse clamitant: tamque considenter, ac •i ad plenum victoriae fructum sola triumphi gloria deesset. Chamierus.saith Augustine.

    _ CHAP. IV. Of the New Testament.

    _ CHAP. V. Of the Books called Apocrypha.

      * Object. If they be not Canonical, therefore because they are not cited; then Nahum and Zephany are not Canonical. Aratus, Menander, and Epimenides, prophane Poets, are Canonical, because they are cited, Acts 17. 28. 1 Cor. 15. 33. Titus 1. 12.

    _ CHAP. VI. Of the Authentical Edition of the Scripture.

      * Object. Psal. 22. 16. There is no Christian, but he readeth 〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉Caru, they have pierced my hands and my feet, yet it is in the Hebrew 〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉Caari, as a Lyon.

      * Object. Psal. 19. 4. Vide River. in Comment. & Glassium in Philol. Sac. The Chaldec Paraphrast agrees with the Hebrew. Profectò haec res, ut ingenuè fatear, me quoque aliquando tor•it. Amussis, quae funiculo constat, non omnino voce caret, siquidem architecti & alii artifices, quando aliquid signare aut metiri volunt, dum amussim vel funiculum extendunt, & deinde mittunt, sonum quendam edere Consueverunt. Isaacus Levita lib. 3. contra Lindanum. Illa Coelorum linea, vel ut Tremellius transtulit, Delineatio, id est illa Machina, structuraque orbium Caelestium, quodammodo ad amissim expolita, infinitam artificis Potentiam, sapie•tiamque praedicat. Whitakerus. The Hebrew Books have, In omnem terram exivit linea eorum, Their line is gone forth thorow all the Earth, but the Septuagint turn it 〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉, Hierom, Sonus eorum, Their sound; and StPaul approved of this version, Rom. 10. 18.

Evangelist say, that it is written, therefore it followeth (saith he) that the HebrewIsaiae undecimo, est in Hebraeo vox Netzer quae alludit ad Nazaraeum, imò est ab eadem radice; proinde poterit, si quis velit, eo referri; aut certè non erit versio sed allu•io.

      * Object. The second place urged by Coton, to prove the corruption of the Hebrew, is Matth. 27.Omnes Interpretes locum illum à Matth. citatum ad ea quae scrip•it Zacharias re•ulerunt, nec aliqui eorum de omisso aliquo Ieremiae Prophetico libro cogitarunt. Nisi quod unus est inter Iesuitas qui locum existimat ex duobus conflatum, nempe ex Ieremiae cap. 32. & Zach. cap. 11. & hoc esse usitatum in Scriptura exemplis probat, ut cum verba & testimonia duorum sunt, aut altero omisso alterius tantum nomen exprimatur, aut totum testimonium, quasi unius tantùm esset, significetur. Haec Ie•uita Sanctius (in Zach cap. 11. Hieronymo baec maximè placit solutio, quam Baromus amplectitur, ut & Iansenius, Mald•natus, & Suarez, Matth•um suo more tantum pos•isse quod dictum est per Prophetam, ab aliquo autem in margine scriptum fuisse Ieremiam, quod postea Scriptorum incogitantia inter textum irrepserit. Ad hoc facit quod in Syr• versione nomen Prophetae omittitur. Rivetus in Catholico Orthodoxo. Citantur sub nomine Ieremiae, vel quia Zacharias ea à Ieremia, cujus discipulus fuerat, acceperat, vel quia idem binominis fuit, pr•sertim, cum utriusque nominis sit •adem significatio. Id. ibid. 9. The Evangelist cites Ieremiah for that which is to be found only in Zachary.

      * Object. They instance in Rom. 12. 11. to be corrupt, the Greek hath serving the time〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉, for serving the Lord, 〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉.

    _ CHAP. VII. Of the Seventy and Vulgar Translation▪

    _ CHAP. VIII. Of the Properties of the Scripture.

      * Object. Faith was before the Scripture, therefore the Scripture is not the rule of Faith.

      * Object. The Scripture is not perfect with a perfection of parts, because many parts are either defective or excessive.

      * Object. There is something found in the Scripture against the Commandment of God, Deut. 4. 2. therefore there is excess as well as defect; for many Books which we believe to be Canonical, are added.

      * Object. Bellarmine saith, Religion was preserved for two thousand yearsLib. 4. de verbo Dei, cap. 4. Vix ullum videas de Traditionibus agentem, qui non hic magno fastu immoretur Chamie•us. Distinguenda sunt & tempora & personae; Non erant necessariae Scripturae ante legem, ergo ne quidem post legem, non erant necessariae Apostolis, ergo ne nobis quidem: negatur consequenti•. Ratio est, quia aliter Israelitas doceri voluit post legem Deus, aliter ante legem: Aliter Christus Evangelium voluit Apostolis revelari, aliter nobis praedicari. Chamierus. from Adam to Moses onely by Tradition; therefore the Scripture is not simply necessary.

      * Object. Whatsoever things are commended from Scripture are necessary, but so are Traditions, Ergò, They are necessary. Iohn 16. 12. I have yet many things to say unto you; but ye cannot bear them now; therefore (say they) the Lord spake many things which are not written.John 2. 22. Jansenius affirmat, haec multa non suisse diversa ab illis, quae hactenus docuerat, sed illustriorem illorum explicationem, & •uc adducit illud appositè, quod habetur 1 Cor. 3. Christus testatur se discipulis suis omnia tradidisse, Joan. 15. 15. nihil ergo tac•. it.

      * Object. 1 Timothy 6. 20. O Timothy, Keep that which is committed to thy trust. By the name of pledge (saith Bellarmine) not the Scripture, but the treasure of unwritten Doctrine is understood. Depositum (say the Rhemists) is the whole Doctrine of Christianity, being taught by the Apostles, and delivered their Successors.

      * Object. 2 Pet▪ 3. 16. Peter saith there, That in the Epistles of Paul there are 〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉, Some things hard to be understood, which they that are unlearned aend unstable wrest, as they doe also the other Scriptures unto their own destruction.

    _ CHAP. IX. Of the Interpretation of Scripture.

      * Object. 1. They object that place, Exod. 18. 13, 26.Primo non sequitur à lege ad Evangellum. Secundò non sequitur à Mose ad Episcopum Romanum, qui hic non eundem locum tenet inter Christianos, quem Moses inter Iudaeos. Chamier.

      * Object. 2. They urge that place, Deut. 17. 9.

      * Object. 3. Eccl. 12. 11. If the chief Pastor in the Old Testament had such authority, much more the chief Priest in the New.

      * Object. Matth. 6. 19. Christ saith to Peter, To thee will I give the Keyes of the Kingdome of Heaven; Therefore the Pope hath Authority to expound Scripture.

1. THE SECOND BOOK. OF GOD.

    _ CHAP. I. That there is a God.

    _ CHAP. II. What GOD is.

    _ CHAP. III. That GOD is a Spirit, Simple, Living, Immortall.

      * Object. God is said to have Members, Face, Hands, Eyes, in some places of Scripture,Psal. 34. 16. Zech. 4. 10. and yet in others he is said not to be a body, but a Spirit; and consequently to have no hands nor eyes.

    _ CHAP. IV. That GOD is Infinite, Omnipresent, Eternal.

      * Object. The Angels and Saints see the Essence of God, therefore it is not infinite, Matth. 18. 10. 1 Cor. 13. 12. 1 Iohn 3. 2.

      * Object. God is said to descend and ascend.God is said to descend and ascend two ways:

      * Object. If God be every where, how is he then said to dwell in heaven? Psal. 2. 4. From those places, Isa. 66. 1. Mat. 6. 9. Vorstius thus argues, The Scripture placeth God there, therefore he is there onely.

      * Object. How can God be said to depart from man, if he be every where.

      * Object. If God were eternal, where was he before the world was? and what did he before he made all things? Vide Augustini Confess. l. 11. c. 12. and why did he make the world no sooner then a few thousand years since?

      * Object. Is not the Creation of the world past with God, when he made it in six days, and the day of judgement to come?

    _ CHAP. V. That GOD is Immutable.

      * Object. God doth repent, Gen. 6. 6. 1 Sam. 15. 11. 2 Sam. 24. 16. Psal. 135. 14. Ier. 26. 13. & 18. 8. to repent imports a change.

      * Object. God promiseth and threatneth some things which come not to pass.

      * Object. God is reconciled with men, with whom he was offended before.

      * Object. Why are Prayers or means, if God be Immutable? why do I pray or hear?

      * Object. God created the world, and so Christ was incarnate and made man; now he that was made something he was not before, or did make something he made not before, seems to be changed. He is a man, he was not so once; he is a Creator, he was not so from eternity.

    _ CHAP. VI. That GOD is Great in his Nature, Works, Authority, a necessary Essence, Independent, wholly One.

      * Object. Why doth God use the help of others?

      * Object. Why is there sin in the world, seeing God needs not any glory that comes to him by Christ, and by his mercy in pardoning of sin? Why doth he suffer it.

      * Object. How comes it to pass, that God makes one thing better then he did at first? as in the Creation, all things had not their perfection at first.

    _ CHAP. VII. Of Gods Understanding that he is Omniscient, and of his Will.

    _ CHAP. VIII. Of Gods Affections, his Love, Hatred.

    _ CHAP. IX. Of the Affections of Anger and Clemency, given to God Metaphorically.

      * Object. Fury is not in me, Isa. 27. 4.

    _ CHAP. X. Of Gods Vertues, Particularly of his Goodnesse.

      * Object. God is infinitely good (say the Arminians) therefore he cannot but naturally will good to the creature.

      * Object. How doth it agree with Gods goodnesse, that it is said Psal. 18. 27. With the froward he will shew himself froward?

    _ CHAP. XI. Of Gods Grace and Mercy.

      * Quest. Whether mercy and justice be equal in God, and how can he be most just and most merciful?

    _ CHAP. XII. Of Gods Iustice, Truth, Faithfulnesse.

    _ CHAP. XIII. Of GODS Patience, Longsuffering, Holinesse, Kindenesse.

    _ CHAP. XIV. Of GODS Power.

    _ CHAP. XV. Of Gods Glory and Blessednesse.

      * Quest. Whether the infinite glory which God hath as God, be communicated to Christs humane nature.

      * Object. Christ prayed for the glory which he had before the beginning.

    _ CHAP. XVI. Of the Trinity The word Essence or Trinity are not found in Scripture, but Essence is duly derived thence; for seeing God saith that He is Exod 3. Essence is fitly ascribed to him. Trinity hath a sufficient ground, There are three that bear witness in heaven, 1 John 5. 7. and the most ancient Fathers use the word. The word Person is extant, Heb. 1. 3. therefore these words are rightly used in the Church. Calvinus ait, in Trinitate non comprehendi essentiam, quasi una •it ex numero tr•um, sed includi in omnibus tribus, quod quidem verissimum est, atque utinam sic semper erraret Calvinus. Bellarm. de Christo l. 2. c. 5. or Distinction of Persons in the Divine Essence.

      * Object. Matth. 19. 17. Christ denieth that he was good because he was not God.

      * Object. Ioh. 17. 3. God the Father is called the only true God.See Rom. 16. 27. 1 Cor. 8. 6 Ephes. 4. 6. Debitus Patri à Filio honor redditur, cùm dicit: te solum Deum: non tamen se Filius à Dei veritato secornit cum adjungit: Et quem mi•isti Iesum Christum. Non habet intervallum confessio credentium, quia in utroque spes vitae est. Hilarius lib. 3. de Trinitate. The words are to be read (as we render them) That they may know thee (to be) the only true God, not, That they may know thee only (to be) the true God, according to the first reading, the predicate is common to the Father and the Son. Vide Bezam.

      * Object. Ephes. 4. 6.

      * Object. Iohn 14. 28. My Father is greater then I.

      * Object. Prov. 8. 22. Ariu•Ariu• stumbled at the Greek Text 〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉, The Lord created me, and on that corrupt Translation grounded his heresie, That Christ was a creature. Christ is God by nature, Gal, 4. 8. which place was strongly urged by MrCheynel against Earbury, who held, that the Saints have the same fulnesse of the God-head dwelling in them, as it doth in Christ, and that the Spirit is but the power of God in the man Christ An Account given to the Parliament by the Ministers, sent by them to Oxford.objected this place, The Lord possessed me in the beginning of his way.

      * Object. Col. 1. 15. Christ is called the first-born of every creature, therefore he is a creature. Here the Arrians say, Christ is imanifestly called a creature. Cum Christus prim•genitus omnis creaturae sit, eum unum • numero creaturarum esse oportere necesse est. Ea enim in Scripturis vis est primogeniti, ut primogenitum unum ex eorum genere, quorum primogenitus est, esse necesse est. Catechis. Eccl. Polon. c. 1. de persond Christi.

1. THE THIRD BOOK. OF Gods Works

    _ CHAP. I. Of Gods Decree, and especially of Predestination, and the Parts thereof, Election and Reprobation.

      * Object. If God should not predestinate for some thing in us, he is an accepter of persons, for all were alike, Iudas was no more opposite then Peter; why then should one be elected and not another?

      * Obj. Predestination or Election is grounded on Gods foreknowledge, Rom. 8. 28, 29▪ 1 Pet. 1. 2. Ergo, say the Papists, God out of the foresight of mans good works, did elect him. And the Arminians say that God elected them out of the foresight of mens faith and perseverance; so Election and Predestination shall be grounded on the will of man.

      * Obj. 1 Tim. 2. 4. Who will have all men to be saved.

      * Obj. 2 Pet. 3. 9▪ Not willing that any should perish, but that all should come to repen tance: therefore there is not an election of some, and reprobation of others.

    _ CHAP. II. 2. The Execution of Gods Deeree.

    _ CHAP. III. Of the Creation of the Heavens, the Angels, the Elements, Light, Day and Night.

    _ CHAP. IV. Of some of the Meteors, but especially of the Clouds, the Rain, and the Sea, the Rivers, Grasse, Herbs, and Trees.
BY the name of Clouds and Waters above the Firmament, Gen. 1. We may understand all Meteors both wat
Obj. How can it be conceived, that the clouds above, being heavie with water, should not fall to the earth, seeing every heavie thing naturally descendeth and tendeth down-ward?
Hath the rain a Father? or who hath begotten the drops of Dew? Out of whose womb came the rain and t
    _ CHAP. V. Of the Sun, Moon and Stars.

    _ CHAP. VI. Of the Fishes, Fowls, Beasts.

    _ CHAP. VII. Of the Angels good and bad.

      * Quest. 1. Whether the Devils have all their punishment already?

      * Quest. 2. How can they be punished with fire?

      * Quest. 3. Whether the Devils shall torment the wicked after the day of Judgement? This is handled by the Schoolmen; I see no reason (saith Voetius) why the affirmative may not be admitted, although it is not to be made an Article of Faith.

      * Quest. 4. What is the meaning of those Stories, Possessed with Devils?

      * Quest. 5. The meaning of Christs temptation by Satan, and how we shall know Satans temptations?

    _ CHAP. VIII. 2. Of MAN.

    _ CHAP. IX. Of GODS Providence.
TWo things are to be discussed about it.Moses affirmeth Gen. 2. that God rested from all the works w

Object. 1 Cor. 9. 9. Doth God take care for Oxen?
The government of the world is in the hand of Christ as Mediator, Isa. 49. 8. Iohn 5. 22. When Adam 
Object. The adversity of the good, and prosperity of the wicked seem to oppose Gods providence. If there were any providence, God would see that it should be Bonis benè, & malis malè: si Deus est, unde mala, si non est, unde bona?
The godly are many times brought to great straights:1. That their sufficiency may be in God alone, a

      * Corollaries from Original sin.We should be humble, not only for the sinnes of our lives, but for our original sin, so David, Psal. 51. and Paul, Rom. 7. latter end: the pollution of nature in us: All sin is in our natures virtually, though not formally.

    _ CHAP. IV. Of Actual Sin.

    _ CHAP. V. Of the Evill of Sinne.

    _ CHAP. VI. Of the Degrees of Sinne.

    _ CHAP. VII. That all Sins are Mortal.Lex Dei prohibet omnia etiam levissima peccati quae venialia vocabulo autiquo, sed ineptè & impiè ab adversariis usurpato, vocantur. Baronius Disput. Theol. de peccato mortali & veniali. Sectione 1. Vide plura ibid. Sectione 2. & 3.

Some sins there are comparedBellarmin. ubi supra.The Papists have devised smoaky distinctions of peccatum simpliciter, and secundum quid, they say, Venial sinne is not properly sin, but imperfectly and analogically, no transgression, but praetergression of the divine Law, and that it is pardoned without repentance, even by the outward sprinkling of holy water. to very light things, as hay, stubble, a mote, a farthing.

      * Object. James 1. 15. Sin When it is perfected brings forth death, therefore not every sin, not sin in every degree.

      * Object. Mat. 12. 36. He saith not, we shall be condemned for every idle word, but only that we shall be called to answer for it.

      * Object. There is a mortal sin, 1 Iohn 5. 16. therefore a venial sin.

      * Concerning National sins.

    _ CHAP. XI. Signes of a Christian in regard of sinne, and that great corruptions may be found in true Christians.

    _ CHAP. XII. Two Questions resolved about sinne.

      * Quest. 1. HOw can grace and corruption stand together, so that corruption poisons not grace, nor grace works out corruption, when the admitting of one sin by Adam kill'd him presently?

      * Quest. 2. Wherein lies the difference between a man sanctified and unsanctified in regard of the body of corruption?

    _ CHAP. XIII. Of the Saints care to preserve themselves from sin, and especially their own iniquities.

    _ CHAP. XIV. Of the cause of forbearing Sin, of abhorring it, and of small Sins.

    _ CHAP. XV. Of some particular sins, and specially of Ambition, Apostacy, Backsliding, Blasphemy, Boasting, Bribery.

      * AMBITION

      * Apostacy.

First, If one degree of grace may fail, why not another, and so grace wholly decay?

Secondly, We reade many examples in Scripture of forward disciples that seemed to be sanctified, and fell, Iudas an Apostle, D•mas and Alexander companions of Paul, and Nicholas the Deacon.

Thirdly, The Scripture speaks of those that denied the Lord that bought them, 2 Pet. 2. 1.

Fourthly, Others urge that place much, Ezek 8. 21, 24, 25, 26, 27.See B. Mount. Appeal ch. 4. Mr. Goo•w. Redemption redeemed. c. 12. Pestilentes sunt Magistri qui negant id fieri posse quòd Deus & fieri posse & realiter à s• puniri testatur, Grotius in v. 24.

Object. 6. Those examples of David when he committed adultery and put Uriah to death; and Peter when he so shamefully denied his Master, are urged also to prove Apostacy.

Drunkards live (like fishes) in liquido, in the water, they make the Tavern their Temple, Indian smoke their Incense, Sack their Sacrifice.

Deinde fides est ita Dei opus ut nostrum non sit, utpote in quo Deo non cooperamur, sed merè Deum operantem patimur; cum in aliis bonis operibus Deus ita operetur, ut nostrae animae sacultates ab operatione non excludantur. Cart w. in Harmon. Evang. Faith justifies instrumentally, correlatively, not because of any worth in it, but because of the excellency of Christ, not dispositively by being the root of other graces, so the Papists affirm, but then it would still be in the way of a work.

CHRIST delivered the Lords praier at two several times, and upon severalMatth. 6. 9. Ut decem praece
Object. We never reade, that the Apostles used this prescript form of words in praier.

This praier (say some) is found written in two books of the New Testament,Evangelistae duo Matthaeus & Lucas qu•rum neuter non optime & callebat, & exprim•▪ bat Christi ment•m, non eisdem per omnia, verbis, in eadem explicanda, usi sunt. Robins. Apol. Brown. c. 3. (viz. Matth. 6. Luke 11.) but with diversity of termes, and the one of these Evangelists omits that which the other hath written. How then ought we to pronounce it?

Object. Act. 2. 38. Repent, and be baptized every one of you in the Name of Iesus Christ, for the remission of sins.

    _ CHAP. VIII. Of Baptism.

Go teach all Nations and baptize them, thereby intimating that they should not baptize those who were not made Disciples by teaching. Infants cannot be made Disciples by teaching, Ergò, Infants may not be baptized.

      * Object. All that are to be baptized have actual faith and repentance. See Mar. 1. 4. Acts 2. 37. onely such were baptized by the Apostles, as appears in divers

Object. Some (saith Bellarmine) are abstemious and abhorre wine, they cannot endure it, and it may offend sickly persons.

Object. Whosoever shall eat this bread or drink this Cup unworthily, shall be guilty of the body and bloud of Christ, the conjunction Or (say they) doth so dis-joyn both kindes, that it is free to take one without the other.

Object. Act. 2. 42. & 20. 7.

Object. Bellarmine de Eucharist l. 4. c. 25. saith, There is a plain difference between the Bread and Cup, for 1 Cor. 11. he saith of the Bread absolutely Do this, but of the Cup conditionally, As oft as ye do it, therefore those words do not signifie that the Cup should alwayes be given when the Sacrament is administred, but they only prescribe the manner, that if it be so, then it should be done in memory of Christs passion.

Object. More irreverence will be shewed to the Sacrament by spilling of it, to which in a great multitude of Communicants the wine must needs be subject to.
